1. process of developing the tool


Through the course we discovered that the use case regarding indoor environment were more complex than expected. This was due to the fact, that the use case could be subdivided. This concluded, that we only got answers to the little part of the indoor environment that we worked with, and therefore still have a lot of questions to the rest of the indoor environment part of bim.

We think it was better to have a lot of choice, since not everybody in the course have the same interest (for instance LCA, structures etc). And we also also think that it was good that we only were limited by the over all use case, and not any further parameters. 

It would have been nice to only focus on for instance integrating the IFC model into python, and not focusing on learning to many new coding languages such as HTML. Maybe include a few more example in the couples of weeks, so everybody gets allined. 

The process gave a huge amount of knowlegde for further work, because we both got to see how complex IFC and BIM are, but also only saw the tip of the iceberg, of what is possible to do, if you are able to crack the code.

It could be nice to include in the thesis some day, since it is a very interesting way to solve future problems, and what BIM can provide to this. 


2. output of the tool
* did the tool address the use case you identified?
* was the use case well modelled
* was the project clearly scoped

3. Future

* Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis
* Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years?


Feedback from others:
Good things:

Bussiness value
Excel output
Use of ifc concepts
directly in python without blender

Improvements:

Other components 
HTML - make it easy to use
Further development in another program and another country
Json file? something the user needs to be aware of - might not that good?
Doesn't take windows into account?


Think about the building component, it may be more complex than you think? For instance a wall maybe have a window, lineloss etc. 

For simplificeret gør det urealistik og dermed ubrugbart - tænk over det i processen om man bør sadle om 


Indoor etc. next year:
- Start simple, add details later
- Coding tutorials/examples
- Communcate with other groups with similar use cases
- Code peer review/code sharing
