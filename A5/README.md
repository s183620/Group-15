# 1. process of developing the tool

Through the course we discovered that the use case regarding indoor environment were more complex than expected. This was due to the fact, that the use case could be subdivided. This concluded, that we only got answers to the little part of the indoor environment that we worked with, and therefore still have a lot of questions to the rest of the indoor environment part of bim.

We think it was better to have a lot of choice, since not everybody in the course have the same interest (for instance LCA, structures etc). And we also also think that it was good that we only were limited by the over all use case, and not any further parameters. 

It would have been nice to only focus on for instance integrating the IFC model into python, and not focusing on learning to many new coding languages such as HTML. Maybe include a few more example in the couples of weeks, so everybody gets allined. 

The process gave a huge amount of knowlegde for further work, because we both got to see how complex IFC and BIM are, but also only saw the tip of the iceberg, of what is possible to do, if you are able to crack the code.

It could be nice to include in the thesis some day, since it is a very interesting way to solve future problems, and what BIM can provide to this. 


# 2. output of the tool

The final tool did not adresse the first use case that we made. Because we were way to ambitious at first. But after we had modified the use case, the result we got from the tool and the tool it self, gave us what we wanted.

The use case were modelled in a very simplyfied way, because we have had to make some assumptions about materials, placement etc. But the simplifyed use case was not very far from the reality, so with very few tweeks, the use case could have been modelled better.  

The scope of the project got better and better though the course. This is also due to the fact that we got more and more aware of what the use case could bring to the project, and what it couldn't.

# 3. Future

We are open to use OpenBIM tools for some of our future work, because we now are aware of what it can be used for and what it can bring to a project.

We are very sure that OpenBIM will be a part of our future worklife
