# Final project - Indoor climate 

## Purpose and presentation of the tool

The overall purpose of the project, was to create a tool for the MEP engineers, which could support the calculation of indoor climate. 
The tools is made as a script that calculates the u-value for certain building components, in this case the external walls, but could also be the roof, floor etc. This was to insure that the building complies the building regulation, and is suppose to be an easy way to check this. 

Due to the specific requirements regarding indoor climate in the building regulation, these calculations can have essential meaning for both the overall design and the construction use cases. It should also be considered in relation to other use cases, since it can have a smaller impact upon those.

## Step by step guide for the tool

The tool will be made of four steps scripted in python:

Step 1 - Gather information: Analyze the different external components.

Step 2 - Calculations: Heat loss and heat transport.

Step 3 - Building regulation: Is it complied or not?

Step 4 - Optimization: Are any changes or optimization nescessary?

The tool gives an quick overview about whether or not the building complies with simple requirements from the building regulation. The tool will be a timesaver, and the employer will quickly be able to determined if the design should be optimized or not.

Since the tools secures a more productive process, the tool also reduce human ressources on a building project. The tool does not consider overconsumption of materials, but could be implemented in a later version.
