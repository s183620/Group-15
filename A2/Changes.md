## Changes in the script

Since our focus area is indoor climate, we decided to look at the windows instead of the floors. Therefore we changed the script into counting the overall numbers of windows in the building instead. 

In the actual skript, we had to change the index file, and therefore also the HTML.py file, and the js and css files too.
