### Use case - indoor climate

The use case focus is indoor climate, and especially the heatloss over the external building parts. For this, we need the materials and the openings in the outer building parts. Therefore we have tried to get some of these informations out with the new script.

The changes we have made, is described in the Changes.md file.

### What information can you get from the IFC for your use case from the previous assignment?

In the previous assignment, we got to know about different IFC components, such as IFCWindows, IFCWalls etc. 
We also benefit from the knowlegde about how different IFC properties are linked to each IFC component. And how it is used to link more than one component to another. 

### What guidance might the 'end user' need?

The end user will need to know 

### What analysis can you perform to support this guidance based on the info you have available?


### Changes made directly to the index.html file
