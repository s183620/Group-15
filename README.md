# A1 Open Bim
## Group 15

### Use case, script and IFC
The focus area is indoor climate analysis. This is primarily for MEP engineers, but also relevant for the client and and the architects.
The main focus is optimize the building performance in terms of heat loss, radiation, thermal convection and conductivity in the outher construction. 

The script will be used for gathering information regarding the focus area, from the IFC model. The goal is to find information about walls, windows, doors, floor and roof. Including dimensions, materials and placement of openings in the facade.

### Disciplinary expertise and analysis 

-What disciplinary (non BIM) expertise did you use to solve the use case?

To achieve the goal, it will be necessary to have knowledge regarding indoor climate in general, the building regulation and the intended use of the building. Knowledge regarding the different buildingmaterials and it's functions which might impact the indoor environment. For instance the windowglass and it's transmission.

-What disciplinary analysis does it require?

Further more it will be a must to know how to calculate the three types of heat transfer and the heat loss.


- What building elements are you interested in?
For checking the indoor climate, it will be necessary to analyze the walls and it's openings, spaces, floors and roof.
